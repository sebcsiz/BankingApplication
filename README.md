# My Personal Project

My personal project will be an "online" banking system software. This will give the user the ability to
first create an account/multiple accounts and to access said accounts. While accessing the account, the 
user will have the option to deposit money, withdraw money and potentially gamble their life savings away :)
via an integrated mini-game of chance which is connected to their account balance (if I have enough time 
and is reasonably in scope for difficulty and time for CPSC 210). Not too sure of who will use this, but if 
I ever decide to open a bank, I could use this application as a starting basis. The reason of why I am 
choosing to make a banking application is mainly because I couldn't think of anything cooler to do and I am
running out of time to choose something for the project, but also because when I started coding, I tried to 
make the same thing, but failed miserably because I didn't understand basic coding concepts O_o. In also want to
try and implement some real-life algorithms myself (such as ***Luhns Algorithm***)

## Possible additions:
- Credit score system based off of income and timely payments
- Ability to open up credit accounts => Would implement Luhns Algorithm as validity checker
- Ability to open up mortgage based on credit score
- Move money between accounts
- Mini stock market (I feel like this might be too ambitious)
